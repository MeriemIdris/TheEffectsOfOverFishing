        Fishing is one of the most significant drivers of declines in ocean wildlife

        populations. Not only does it cause several negative physiological/

        psychological issues for the fish population, it also increases the

        stress levels and bodily injuries resulting from lodged fish hooks... It

        may also cause the increase of prey species (mess up the food chain) when

        the target fishes are predator species, such as salmon and tuna.


        If we continue to fish at the rate we are, the ocean will run out of fish by

        the year 2050.

<hr>
        Aquafarms are places where fish are confined in tightly packed areas.

        Because of this, the water can become toxic, and it - along with parasites,

        pesticides, and feces- are spread all over our oceans, killing healthy fish.

        The Blue Marine Foundation (BLUE) is a charity dedicated to restoring

        the ocean to health by addressing overfishing & the fishing industry.
